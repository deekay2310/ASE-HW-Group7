# Repertory Grids for Streaming Services

## Introduction

Our topic for this part of the homework is 'Streaming Services' where we first proceeded with the step of conducting the interview. This was done by each of us interviewing a separate candidate. During this period, we did not discuss or share information with each other in terms of what attributes our interviews were based on.

## Data and Interviews

From our interviews, the data that has been collected will differ significantly because of the different attributes. However, there are a couple of similar themes amongst the different attributes we chose. The attribute `EasyToUse:DifficultToUse` and `NotSoGoodUserExperience:GoodUserExperience` in two different grids still represents the theme of `User Experience`. 

## Clusters

### Attributes

Talking about clustering of attributes, we did observe some interesting correlations popping up in the form of attribute clusters which demonstrated the dependability of one attribute over other. For example, the attributes `LessValueForMoney:MoreValueForMoney` and `LessVariety:MoreVariety` formed a cluster which conveys that the user found more value for money in a service having more variety in terms of content.

Another correlation worth noting is `LessPopularShows:MorePopularShows` and `Economical:Expensive` where it can be observed that services with more popular shows are generally expensive. From one of the interviews, the relation between User Experience and Popularity of the service is also established with the presence of the cluster `LessSubscribers:MoreSubscribers` and `NotSoGoodUserExperience:GoodUserExperience`. Here, it can be determined that User Experience plays a vital role in retention of subscribers.

### Services

In terms of the clusters formed amongst the services, the most evident one is of `Amazon Prime` and `Netflix`. This could perhaps be the case because of the immense popularity that these two services have. All the candidates that were interviewed had subscribed to these two services. In fact, that is the case with us (the interviewers) as well as most of the people we know. This strengthens the fact that `Amazon Prime` and `Netflix` are the most popular Streaming Services.

## Conclusion

To conclude, most of our existing assumptions and experiences with these streaming services were validated with these grids. The repertory grid provided a great way to structure the information obtained from these interviews to derive necessary conclusions about the state of streaming services.
